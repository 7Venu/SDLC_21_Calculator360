# Calculator360

## Introduction
## What is Calculator360?
A calculator is a useful machine to solve arithmetical problems. The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More sophisticated calculators can handle the electrical, physics, medical and financial calculations. The purpose of a calculator is to do correct calculations, and to do so efficiently. The design of the calculator is simple. It has various components to input the problem and display the output of the problem. The key layout of the device is also very simple for providing easy access to the user. Calculator360 supports multiple calculations across various subjects.
## Advantages of Calculator360
1. You can solve tedious and most difficult problems across various subjects.
2. It is an easy-to-use device.
3. Moreover, the biggest advantage is that calculations are always accurate.



## State of Art
|   Time        |   Features |      Cost   |
| ---------------|------------|-------------|
|  2500BC       | Abacus - which was used for simple addition and subtraction|It was handmade and cheaper, but less efficient  |                                       
|  1642         | Pascal calculator - which could be perform all the basic arithmetic operation but difficult to produce | The device was complex , expensive and rare |
|  1860         | Mechanical Calculator â€“ which was easier to produce but was bulkier and hard to carry | The device was expensive but less complex |
|  1945         | Mechanical Handheld calculator easier to produce and lighter  | The device is cheaper than bulk mechanical calculator|
|  1970         |  Introduction of Digital pocket calculator  | The device is very cheap and easy to use|
|  1995         | Multiuse calculator began to replace the single use calculator and provided more features | Cheap calculators with multiple features is widely used today|
|  2001         | Smartphones and desktop now comes with sophisticated inbuilt calculators |  Inbuilt powerful calculator comes free with smartphones and desktops |
